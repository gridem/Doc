# Geo Social Network

The idea is to union people based on geolocality. User may posts articles and articles score depends on the geodistance and number of likes. The thing is that geolocality place important role for the people, sometimes even more important than the global news.

## Regions Representation

Each region forms an hierarchy (tree) of other region. Root region is the Earth.

Each region is represented by the person who responsible to manage and to rule of that region. He may decide what to do, how to administrate the region etc.

Periodically leaf regions elect parent manager. Those managers elect their own managers etc. 

## Money

Region Manager may collect the money and spent them for the region needs. Some percent of money goes up to hierarchy, some percent goes to the social network itself. Thus there is no special monetization program.

## Future

The aim is to grow the force based on the geo regions to represent different people wishes and to improve the life around them. The only way is to use local transformation near to each person.
